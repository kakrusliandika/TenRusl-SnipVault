# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
-   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on the repository or via email to **community@tenrusl.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** — Community impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional. Consequence: A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** — Community impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban** — Community impact: A serious violation of community standards. Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community.
